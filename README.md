Airbnb Homes Analysis

I am Aseem Narula, currently pursuing the Nanodegree in Data Science from Udacity,is going to present the project-1 'Write a Data Science Blog Post'.I have used the Kaggle platform to analyze the Seattle and Boston AirBNB homes datasets.In this Jupyter Notebook, I am using the CRISP-DM in my process for finding solutions

In this GitHub repository, I have done the data analysis using the Pandas and Seaborn, Matplotlib data visualisation libraries in the Pyton.The objective is to use the CRISP DM methodology to drive the Data Science Project to answer the business questions along with presenting the meaningful business data insights to the audience..

The CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is a process model with six phases that naturally describes the data science life cycle. It’s like a set of guardrails to help you plan, organize, and implement your data science (or machine learning) project.

1. Business understanding – What does the business need?

2. Data understanding – What data do we have / need? Is it clean?

3. Data preparation – How do we organize the data for modeling?

4. Modeling – What modeling techniques should we apply?

5. Evaluation – Which model best meets the business objectives?

6. Deployment – How do stakeholders access the results?
